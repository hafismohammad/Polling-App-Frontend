# Real-time Polling Application with Chat Feature 

Poll Chat is a real-time poll and chat application designed to create, manage, and participate in polls seamlessly while communicating through live chat. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), the app uses Socket.IO for real-time updates, including voting, chat messages, and notifications. Users can create polls, cast votes, chat with others, and receive instant updates about poll results. The app ensures secure authentication and efficient data handling using JWT for user sessions and a repository architecture on the server. Poll Chat provides a fast and responsive experience, thanks to the integration of Vite for the client side.
